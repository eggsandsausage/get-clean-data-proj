get-clean-data-proj
===================

This repo contains a script for an assignemnt in the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. The R script will execute on data that can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
Put the data in the ./data folder. Running the runAnalysis function from run_analysis.R will result in two files being created in ./result:
x  - contains
y - contains

The main functionality of this script is extracting, transforming and merging the data from the separate files.
